#this should really be more or less a wrapper function for the c code from the
#Kent Source if we're going to release it as a BioC module. We'll need to check up on
#license issues though.

#Should also really be a module with the various chain files as data or as sep bioc modules.

#create your C or C++ or Fortran code; you may need to include the header #include R.h;
#R CMD SHLIB file.C
#R
#dyn.load(file.so)

#   out <- NULL  
#   .C(myfun,as.integer(n),as.double(x),as.double(out))[[3]] # returns out (the third element of the list returned by .C)  
#}
